We couldn’t spend any time on the beach and when we walked around the area it was run down and grotty.  We had arranged three nights there before heading home but we only stayed one night before going to Colombo.

Negombo is a very beautiful place to visit but BE VERY VERY CAREFUL on what you order.

This happened to me on Sunday 9th March 2025 at a restaurant on the beach side off the strip called "" LAVA PUB AND FAMILY RESTAURANT"".

I saw families enjoying beach games but the cherry on the cake was the groups of friends jamming. Their small cars were packed with a sound system, and they had basic musical instruments themselves using which they produced beautiful, peppy music, setting the note for the evening. After listening to the jam for a few minutes, I took a walk on the pure Negombo Beach.

This is an excellent time to visit. People are desperate for tourists to come and are very welcoming.  The exchange rate is also very attractive…we got 406 rupees/£ at the airport which is the best place to exchange. We stayed at the Heritance hotel for 5 nights  at the end of our three week visit. The hotel was excellent. This is the Main Street  of Negombo and is gradually coming to life as restaurants and shops get busier. The place looks better at night when everything is lit up. There are many tourist souvenir shops and bars restaurants. Terrific value for money. Our fav restaurant was Boho half way up the street and then Prego right across the road from the hotel. There are other restaurants highlighted on Apple Maps but either had changed name or have yet to reopen. Heritance have developed a restaurant and Swiss cafe right across from the hotel. In our 5 days there we didn’t see anyone use either. The restaurant has a Middle Eastern menu, I suggest this was a big part of the problem. The souvenir shops we used all offered discounts without asking.  We loved Diane’s just across from the Gelato cafe. We met the owner and it turned out she had visited U.K. and Edinburgh where we come from. Lovely lady…give her your business. We also used Maya which had some great hippy chic clothes but the staff need a shake to get them away from their phone screens….it was also full of moths and mozzies the night we were there. The beach itself is public so you share it all with the locals and it gets very busy at weekends. During the week it’s perfect for some yoga on the beach early morning or just walking off breakfast. You will get approached by tat sellers but just be polite but firm. Don’t be rude, they’re just trying to make a living. Finally the folk have seen really hard times over the last few years. So be prepared to tip. A little goes a long way for them. If we are at a small hotel we will “adopt” a waiter or pool guy and ensure they get a decent tip at the end of our stay. If we all did that it would make a huge difference to their families and be a great incentive to improve their understanding of service. Go, you’ll love it.","February 8, 2024"

I also went swimming there.  The water is brown and full of sand, but the sand didn’t stick to me like Mirissa beach sand did and care off easily with 1 shower.  The water is calm and makes for easy swimming regardless of ability.  The people there are very friendly.  The beach is more dirty (with garbage/rubbish) all over the place, however, it is nice that you can pretty much guarantee finding a decent amount of space at any part of the beach to call your own.

The international airport serving Colombo and hence Sri Lanka is located there.  So all international travelers arriving by flight pass through Negombo. The city itself is quite large, populous and developed with all amenities such as modern hotels, shopping, very reasonably priced AirBnB accommodations  etc. However, there are just a handful of sightseeing locations such as the fish market, church etc. which are really not much to speak of, in my opinion. Negombo has a long sandy beach with spectacular sunset views. The tourism industry has grown around highlighting Negombo as a beach destination.  During my visit, I walked quite a bit up and down, along the beach and found raw sewage from the city flow directly into the sea, at many different locations. I am a Chemical and Mechanical Engineer and have worked in the Environmental field for the past 32 years.  I can state with a great degree of confidence that the waters in the Negombo beach area are definitely polluted to a large extent, with fecal coli form bacteria and certainly other harmful pollutants. In fairness, the infrastructure for tourists along the beach is quite good with many reasonably priced restaurants and bars. For someone seeking a somewhat cheap beach vacation, Negombo may barely pass as the place of choice   With Sri Lanka as an island nation, there are many other beach destinations which are far better at equivalent cost.","December 22, 2018"

It was great to watch the Sunday cricket, volleyball, and the lively get togethers, having drink at King Coconuts, go and find Josephine one of the beach sellers, she made me laugh so much, everyone comes out for sunset, if you go for an early beach walk you see the fishermen coming in with the days catch and selling on the shore.
