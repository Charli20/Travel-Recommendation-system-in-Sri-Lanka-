When you walk through the jungle, you comfort yourself with the hope of being on something so desolate and feeling like Robinson Crusoe. However, such an obvious thought will not only visit you, and upon arrival you will find that there are fewer people here than on the beach of Unawatuna, but their concentration is significantly higher, as the beach is small and narrow. Significantly less than in Unawatuna. There are, you might say, two. So behind the loneliness, definitely not here! But of course, there are benefits. The wave here to the beach is tangent, so it's quiet. Plus, of course, the mangrove jungle adjacent to the beach creates a different atmosphere. Overall, a great addition to Unawatuna Beach, though not an alternative.","November 20, 2025"

It isn’t easy to reach, the most practical way is by tuk tuk, but even then, a steep, winding path leads you down through jungle. The Jungle Beach is a small, picturesque section of coast, where usually there are only a few people, there are no long promenades or big crowds here. Sometimes, loud barking or noisier tourists disturb the peace, but the beach is still popular for its gentle stray dogs who love to lie beside sunbathers, and the monkeys jumping along the path. There are one or two simple cafés on the beach, where you quickly get your refreshments and can also rent a sunbed.","July 23, 2025"

They check your bags at reception and are not allowed to take any drinks or snacks inside the premises. Totally bizarre… I arrived early and the security man wasn't there, a lady checked my bag, I thought she was just checking for alcohol which might've made sense, I don't drink alcohol. So luckily my first and only visit(I would never go back to a premises with incredibly unhealthy rules like this) I did have my own sports water bottles with me. However knowing as having been a little bit sick recently I need to drink quite a few litres of water per day at the moment, asked for a 1 L of water to mix my electrolytes sachet… They sell only fancy 650 mL glass bottles of water. At extortionate prices I might add. They said it was because their policy was no plastic, it's because they want to charge extortionate prices. Totally agree with cutting down on plastic, and there are ways… but can not their policy of jeopardising peoples hydration health. It isn't a 'swimming pool' per se, if you are looking for a fitness swim this is not the right place it's a play pool, and the establishment is for drinking and partying only. Nothing wrong with that by the way I'm just stating in case others are expecting to go there and have a good swim… You can't. Beautiful setting, lovely beach stunning sea, actually quite nice stuff ... but the whole experience spoilt by lack of care and consideration of health.","March 28, 2025"

The Tuk Tuk drivers will not take you up the hill to the beach unless they are the local drivers - so it makes it a bit difficult to get to. But it is worth the effort. The beach has plenty of tourists and locals and you can take tours from the beach as well. There are restaurants and places to buy drinks etc at the beaches. They are small beautiful beaches and swimming in the ocean here is good for all ages. It is ok for snorkelling but no coral, there are a fair few fish. Potentially the snorkelling tours are better.

During the lunch we ordered at the same cafe began to descend en masse on the lower branches of the monkey. It was pretty interesting. After lunch, the weather started to deteriorate, a little rain came and waves started to rise. Towards the end of the evening, huge black clouds began to move to the left, thunder rattled and lightning shone. Everyone went home en masse.

Initially, we were hesitant because we had read on TripAdvisor that the beach could be overcrowded and littered with garbage. However, our experience was quite the opposite. The beach was clean, the water was calm and perfect for swimming, and we practically had the place to ourselves. The beach bar was closed, which added to the tranquility. Jungle Beach is fairly small, so I can imagine it being quite crowded during the high season. The walk to the beach is about 10 minutes downhill from the car or tuk-tuk park, and it’s important to note that the beach is not wheelchair accessible.","October 20, 2024"

There are a few beautiful fish to see snorkeling however the coral is dull and for us, it wasn't worth snorkeling more than once. The huge benefit to a fifty something lady is a clean, nice smelling and flushing toilet, although I recommend bringing tissues and the torch on your phone as there is no light. It can get quite busy so we always went in the morning. Best to take a tuk tuk to the jungle beach path unless you are very fit as the road is steep and endlessly uphill...even the tuk tuks struggle...

A good stretch of curving sandy beach with one beach bar with a few sunbeds. Busy on National Day with locals but quite quiet another. A very pretty cove with stunning water colour, good swimming with no waves. Around the coast, 200 metres of large rocks to clamber over is the smaller beach. Still very picturesque, just smaller. This can also be accessed from the car park on google maps next to the Peace Pagoda and has a less steep walk to it that the larger jungle beach.","February 17, 2022"

There is a small juice bar but while watching the man make my drink, I just knew I was going to catch something. Not from him necessarily, but from the extreme lack of food hygiene. After my drink I decided to take a boat with a guy named LARA who I found out later was well known for all the wrong reasons, so beware! He is a not honest. And he has very creepy looks. He tried to charge me 20,000 LKR for less than an hour of a boat ride with no stop to see anything. With all the other beaches around Sri Lanka, I would definitely put a pass on this one.

There is a nice shack on the beach that serves decent food at reasonable prices. The water is fresh and clear, the beach nice clean and good sand. When it came to leave I was told that the easiest route was to walk along the sea path back to Unawatuna. I was also told it would take me 5-10 min. How wrong was this info. I am sure a mountain goat could have negotiated the uneven and loose boulders far better than my arthritic sloth like agility, the boulders are rather hazardous but eventually you come to another beach. Then you have to climb back up the mountain !! Bad choice should have gone up the way I went down. However the beach is nice, what would be nice is a boat taxi running at regular intervals from Unawatuna to all these small beaches, when and if this occurs I will go back but until then leave it to those who are more agile.","January 23, 2022"

Sadly, the beach is beautiful but human interference has ruined it. The path down to the beach is well maintained and even swept but the rubbish is just swept off the path into the trees. Having secured a shady spot under a beautiful tree, we were often greeted with wafts of the odour of rotting rubbish which was piled up just behind us. Beach visitors should be encouraged to clean up their litter and the businesses should also take better measures to clean up. If you want to swim, just be cautious as you enter the sea. There is a lot of sharp and broken coral and rocks so kids are likely to get a scrape or two!

Like unawatuna there are no restaurants or hotels. There is one sea food restaurant but prices are bit high compared to outside the beach. This place is crowded in weekends and people come as groups . Therefore better to visit here on weekdays. Sunset is amazing from the beach and you can see Galle city. Not far from highway entrance.

I walked there from Unawatuna and was glad I'd read reviews on here describing how to get there because it is not really signposted until you are almost there. I enjoyed the walk and locals were helpful in pointing me in the right direction. Don't expect an easy stroll - it is quite a trek on uneven and narrow trails with large rocks. However, you may be lucky to see monitor lizards, peacocks and other animals along the way like I did. When I got to the beach I was quite disappointed - maybe it was the time of year but the water was rough and dirty, the sands were littered with rubbish and debris. My belief that I could snorkel in tranquil waters and see lots of beautiful fish was instantly killed. In the 5 mins I tried to go into the water, I got scratched quite badly by rocks you cannot see through the murky waters.  Even when I tried to go into the water further up the beach, I quickly got out again due to the amount of rubbish wrapping itself around my legs. Such a shame - but I bet the waters are calmer, clearer and the beach cleaner at high season in Summer. At least I saw a huge monitor lizard - that was really cool.","October 9, 2018"

First came here over 3 years ago and it felt more exciting back then as it really was like a trek in the jungle but this time, felt that Unawatuna in general and the walk to Jungle Beach was now becoming more built up and busy. The walk passes through dozens and dozens of hotels and B&B's and it is likely to be more crowded and busy once the monstrosity of a hotel is built in the Unawatuna beach! So better get here quick before it loses its charm. The positives is that because the area still belongs to the Dept of Wildlife, they have stopped or done away with the previous make-shift restaurants that were right by the beach at Jungle Beach. It seems to be more of a place where a lot of locals come in for a day/weekend trip. Since we went there on a Sunday, it was very busy. Also a tad noisy but everyone seemed to be having a good time. You can swim here too but the sea is now seems to be littered. Strangely though the walk from Unawatuna and though the jungle seemed clean and came across only a few discarded PET bottles. The climb is only slightly difficult but recommend shoes unless you are a flip-flop pro in which case you can still easily do the climb up and down unless you are unlucky to do the trek on a rainy day. Make sure to take lots of water though, as it is humid. There are a few restaurants around in the vicinity before you climb down to the beach that offers local food for good prices. We didn't have lunch there, so no idea how the food was. If you don't fancy eating after the walk, you can always a grab a bite to eat once you get to Dalewala road which has all the touristy shops/restaurants.","October 1, 2018"

As to the snorkeling, don't waste your time.  Very little fish to see, no coral, and poor water clarity (and I think we were on a good day for water clarity.)  Honestly, we brought our snorkel gear on our trip to Sri Lanka because of hopes to snorkel at jungle beach, if I go back, I won't bother carrying the stuff with me.  The beach itself was nice in the morning with a good amount of tourists, but not enough to be crowded.  Around about noon things started to get busy as many mothers were coming to the beach with their kids after school let out.  I didn't find any issue with this group of people other than the fact that there were a ton of them.  They just kept coming and coming and things were getting really crowded.  I am talking about going from roughly 50 - 60 tourists at the beach to probably 200+ after school crowd and growing.  So we decided to pack up and move on. If you want a somewhat secluded, calm beach with kind of clear water, then come by Jungle Beach in the morning and enjoy.  Other than that, I wouldn't bother coming to this beach.  Honestly, when back in Sri Lanka, I won't visit this beach again.  There are way better places than this.","April 3, 2018"

There is a small beach bar with drinks and some food choices and sun loungers. Getting there - follow signs from Unawantuna foot paths. You will be walking on a trail through the jungle until you get to a first beach (this is not Jungle Beach). From here, go to the end of this first beach and find the trail entry point to walk another 10 minutes to Jungle Beach. Total hike time is approximately 30-45 minutes.

There is a short, tricky, (in flip flops) walk down, through jungle, from the road, to the beach.  This was fun though because the trees were filled with monkeys.  The beach was relatively quiet, which I also liked.  The sea was very calm here, unlike other places such as Bentota and Negumbo where it was rough.  The reason I loved it so much was that the snorkelling was amazing!!  It was like swimming in a huge aquarium. There were fishes of all colours and sizes, many I hadn't seen before and the absolute bonus was there were also turtles. This would have been a completely perfect experience, but there was quite a bit of rubbish around the edges of the beach, I think, probably washed up by the tide.

One can see monkeys, the Japanese Pagoda, stop by the side of the road and drink some coconut water, etc. The views are simply spectacular. Once at the beach, then things get a bit disappointing: trash everywhere, from condom wrappers to discarded water bottles and everything in between. This is a preferred spot for locals who come in large groups to party at the beach. The beach itself is nice enough but the view is dreadful: looking out from the beach into the horizon, one sees the entire port and industrial Galle complex in the near distance. The opposite of the idyllic images “jungle beach” conjures. I stayed about half an hour and walked back to Unawatuna beach with its wonderful never ending horizon to look at, not an industrial/port facility. There is a restaurant before one goes down to the beach which is nice and worth visiting. If you are looking for a walk, this is the place to go, if you are looking for a pristine, off the beaten path beach, THIS IS NOT that place. My advise is to stay in Unawatuna and beyond, the beaches are easily accessed and the views and spaces more relaxing and beautiful.
