It is a 100% tourist spot, which inflated food and drink prices. For example, a coconut costs 250 rupees, while in Colombo or Galle it costs 100 rupees. Water 170 rupees, vs 100 rupees in the capital. The sea and the beaches are not extraordinary. If it is not millennial, this is not a suitable destination.","December 18, 2025"

It is chock a block full of hotels and guest houses, eventually it will become like Benedorm but on smaller scale as there is not much more room to build. All the resturaunts are in what you would describe as a cartel, they all have similar menus and they all charge very similar prices so hardly any chance of a bargin. They all have a service charge which means you have to pay even if the service is poor, rather than tipping for goood service. Similar on the beach at the seafood resturants, same menu hardly any variation in price. When you visit the fish markets and see how much you can buy fish, prawns, crabs etc they are making a killing. I know they have overheads but there is no compertition between them. Having said that very nice beaches and friendly people which is what most people go there for. Like me the majority of people are touring around the island and it is a stop off point unless you surf.","September 1, 2025"

Everywhere you go there are cardboard signs advertising ‘swimming with whales’, ‘snorkel with turtles’ - the turtles have been laying their eggs for tens of thousands of years and in the lifetime of one turtle (it takes 20 years to mature and return to the same beach to lay eggs) the beach has become overcrowded. The lifeguard have to dig the eggs up each night and put them in a small enclosure fl hatch before releasing them but this is only a small measure as more and more tourists will come to this beach and eventually the turtles will stop breeding. The tuktuk drivers are very pushy and will rip you off, you only know you’re been ripped off the first time as the same journey from an honest driver is half the price. The waiting staff are generally more ambivalent than the rest of the island and not attentive at all, all bills either are double what the advertised rate is due to government tax or the service charge - so beware of that. Whale watching is growing and very sad indeed, we went with the only operator who acted on a policy of observing from afar and we were out all day, other operators went on the basis that they could return as soon as their boat saw a whale and so the blue whale we saw they all chased with their boats all along the coast and returned within an hour.

It’s a place we keep coming back to, and this time was no different. My wife, two kids, and I stayed at the cosy and simple Vacanza Mirissa, just a minute's walk from the famous Mirissa Beach. Its close proximity made it so easy to pop in and out of the beach whenever we pleased, a big win when traveling with kids. The beach was alive but not crowded, locals, surfers, and travellers all soaking up the laid-back island vibe. The kids had an absolute blast bathing in the sea, splashing in the gentle waves, and chasing each other along the shoreline. Seeing them so carefree and happy was a highlight of the trip for us as parents. As the sun began to set, the sky transformed into a stunning canvas of fiery orange, soft pink, and deep purple hues. We grabbed a spot at one of the beachfront cafes and watched the lights from the beach bars start to twinkle, adding an extra touch of magic to the scene. But the real treat of the night was our dinner at Dewmini Roti Shop, a place that deserves every bit of its reputation. The food was absolutely delicious, and it made our last night in Mirissa unforgettable. Mirissa Beach is more than just a beach for us, it’s where family memories are made. With plenty of places to stay, eat, and hang around, it’s a spot that has something for everyone. If you’re after a mix of relaxation, fun, and authentic island life, this is the place to be. We’ll definitely be back.","December 17, 2024"

We had stayed in Unawatuna on a previous visit, so wanted to try a different beach this time. Having spent 7 days on the east coast, which was off season, Mirissa was nearing the end of peak season and much livilier. We wanted a place on the beach side of the road, so choose Sea World hotel, which had fantastic views and excellent breakfast. We didnt book evening meals, because the daily blackouts meant that we had to choose places with a generator. The blackouts during the day didnt bother us, as we spent most of this time travelling around to different beaches and places. Cold beers and food was always available somewhere. The beach bars and restaurants on Mirissa beach were mostly all open day and evening, and even when the blackouts came there were plenty of candles making it even more romantic. I had heard the road along Mirissa beach was very busy and no footpaths and I would have to say it was really dangerous when we were there, especially at night when there was no street lighting. It really was a challenge to avoid speeding tuk tuks and buses. If I was to compare Mirissa to Unawatuna I would say that Unawatuna is at the end of a small road far from the main road, so much safer to walk around the main street and go in and out of bars shops etc","April 7, 2022"

Many of annoying tourist who think that if they come to Sri Lanka everything is for themselves. They disturb and unrespect locals. Otherwise it Mirissa is a long beach nice to walk around. For swimming there might be some problems due to the huge waves. It is nice to go to secret or coconut island and spend a day in a different way. In my opinion i do not like techno and disco music from every bar at the beach what is probably quite normal due to the many tourist from Germany, Russia and Great Britain who came here just to party and drink. This is not for that nice nature beach. Better would be relax music, guitar and waves. That is enough for having a nice relax vacation. The best thing on the beach are turtles who come at the evening and drop their 120-140 eggs in the sand. Amazing thing to see! In one evening we were able to see three of them! The best one was late at evening because at around 7pm people are annoying and with flashes they disturb the turtle to do what they need to. People should show a little respect to those animals. So beach is mixture of everything. Perhaps it suits more to young population due to the loud bars.","February 13, 2020"

Perfect for lazy days and strolling along rather than using the road that runs parallel. It has an abundance of restaurants all selling fish (some fresher than others).

A beautiful walk along the front will take you past the many restaurants and diners, and sun beds are readily available and free! The service at restaurants can vary from incredibly poor to very good, depending on which one you choose, the busier ones are often poor service and waiters can just ignore you completely, so if you do stop for a drink, don't wait for them to come to you! Prices are more expensive on the beach and can be unreasonable if you've got poor service.

First stop was Mirissa Beach & Parrot Rock. You can easily access to the Mirissa beach from the main road and the Parrot rock is visible from miles. Through the beach you can reach Parrot rock. It is a small island separated from the main land and you can have a mesmerizing 360° view of the sea when you climb up. You can swim in the Mirissa Main beach as well as the best place I found is the small beach situated on the right side of the Parrot rock. there the water is shallow for a long distance. But when you go further there will be rocks under water and you have to be careful of it.  Waves are not very tide. Can enjoy a good evening swim there. Children also can enjoy a good swim there. There are some local restaurants by the beach. We did not go there so not sure about the food & beverages they have and the prices. The beach will be lightly crowded in the evening. But the best time to visit also is the evening, around 3-4. After a 1-2hr bath we went to have a hot tea and to eat something. We found this small place called ""Spice Rotti shop"" by the main road. It is on google map. the food was amazing and prices also very affordable. They have a variety of sri lankan foods and in there we met some foreign travellers also. They customize your food up to your taste. If you are around Mirissa prefer to try this place. Don't choose the rainy season to visit Mirissa, as the waves will be rough. Mirissa beach is a Must visit if you are a beach lover.","August 5, 2019"

It was a perfect place to enjoy the beach. The waves can sometimes be big and me and my pre-teen daughter had great fun diving under them as they broke over our heads. But smaller children should stick to paddling in the shallows. There were no hawkers hassling us to buy drinks or trinkets, and the three small stray dogs, whose patch seemed to include that part of the beach, paid us no attention and didn't bother us at all. At night, the beach bars are lit up and are a great place to chill out after a hot day.

The waves were extremely strong, further compromising the normal conditions which feature a strong tidal rip. Assisting with the rescue were two doctors, a nurse, a paramedic and a firefighter. All foreigners. It took ten minutes for local lifesavers to arrive on scene even though they were less than 200m down the beach. Once there the lifesavers stood back and observed without relieving tiring people whom were performing CPR or offering any direction or reassurance that further assistance was on the way. The CPR balloon and defibrillator on site did not function. After we loaded the individual in the ambulance it took a further three minutes for the driver to turn the vehicle around and get it moving towards the hospital. After the ambulance had departed witnesses sought out lifeguards to give a statement; they seemed surprised at this and there was no template for an incident report or recording our details. During discussion one of the lifeguards indicated “today was a bad day to go in the water” but shrugged when asked why people were not being discouraged. I would strongly caution against young children or inexperienced swimmers entering the water here. I hope the individual and his family are okay and I offer my thanks and respect to those people that did what they could to assist.","April 16, 2019"

So cheap it’s not even worth haggling with him. 400 for shorts, 500-700 for dresses, trousers and jump suits. Also little purses and bunting made out of Sri Lankan/Indian material. Very kind man lets you try clothes on and has a mirror. When I was there there was a group of girls trying to haggle the price down but it seemed so silly as they’re SO cheap anyway.

But be aware that it can get very crowded sometimes. We were in February 2019 and until 10 am you had to occupy a sun bed, otherwise they was nothing free anymore until around 4 pm (or you had to be lucky). One thing which i didn't like: all the restaurants (to whom the sunbeds belonged) were telling you at around 4:30 pm-5 pm to get off the sunbeds, because they were replacing them with tables for dinners. I found that they did this much too early ! It was exactly the time when the sun wasn't that strong anymore and it was really nice to lie in the sun and you had to go. I know that it gets dark really fast there, but still , I wish they had begun with this at 6 pm or later. The area around the beach is not nice though. There is a LOT of garbage lying around  everywhere and stinking (especially in the small river, yuck), there is a lot of dust and a lot of noise from the traffic on the main street and also no sidewalk, so you had to pay a lot of attention to the cars coming from both sides. So not really a place to walk relaxed in the evening. The service on the beach is terrible (with a few exceptions). Very slow waiters, you had to wait a lot for everything (menu, drinks, food, even the bill), they forget a lot from the orders and for some of them there is 10% percent service charge already included ( a service which is as I said terrible). But the service and the food is generally much better on the main street than on the beach (we found some places with really amazing food and very good service). So 4 stars for the beach itself, which is very beautiful, but not for the area surrounding the beach or the service on the beach.","March 1, 2019"

Plenty of bars and restaurants. Also surfing for beginners and an added break for experienced surfers at the eastern end. Sadly, this is not the beach for us. Jet Skis in the sea and a seriously busy road that runs the length of the beach. Far too much noise! The restaurants and bars were characterless too. We much preferred the amenities at Weligama Beach but both were eclypsed by Polhena. At Polhena, you're away from the road, it's a reef so there's no jet skis, you can swim with turtles and just down the road is Madiha; proper surf! My advice is to stay in Polhena and take a day trip to Mirissa.","February 20, 2019"

I would usually swim for 3 hours when I go to a beach.  But here I stayed less than an hour.  My fiancée can’t swim very well, so she stayed out of the water.  The waves are unpredictable and can be very high and rough.  I got tossed around like a child by a couple and even got slammed onto the sand by one and my shoulder is still sore days later.  My biggest warning is not about the waves/surf though... after my short time swimming and even going back out to the open water to rub/brush off excess sand from myself, I found that sand had gotten everywhere and it was quite difficult to remove.  I took 3 showers that night and still had sand all over.  When I woke up the next morning, there was sand all over my bedsheets and pillow.  After my 4th shower since my swim, I finally managed to rid myself of the feeling, but I don’t like the feeling of having sand everywhere.

The main road cutting through the town ruins the beach side feel, although that seems common here in Sri Lanka. Too many people meant it was difficult to enjoy the beautiful beaches. Obviously the main draw is the whale watching but after reviewing we decided against due to sheer number of people boats, not my idea of fun I'd suggest bypassing Mirissa in search for queiter beach destinations.","January 24, 2019"

These 2 beaches is just nearby and u can just go to one place to another by bus. Personally I like Unawatuna more than Mirissa. Mirissa is very popular with Whale Watching. You can ask the price around and I can say most of the boat companies / agents selling the ticket for LKR3000 (discounted price). The difference is only, which agent can give you opportunity to sit at the top deck and also at the front row. I bought a whale watching ticket from Panorama Guesthouse Mirissa with a tagline ""money back guarantee"" if you don't see a whale. Unfortunately I can't even see a whale on that day and didn't get my refund. So, my advice..don't worry much about the seating places on the boat, there is no promises when u dealing with nature, animals, etc. If you have a short time in Mirissa, just enjoy the beach and skip whale watching.","January 22, 2019"

Me and my partner visited Mirissa for 3 days and was slightly disappointed. We found that the beach was busy and didn’t look anything like the pictures advertised. The beach is big and wide but I prefer smaller beach with more of a tropical feel to it. Don’t get me wrong if your into surfing it’s great but not so great for a relaxing swim. We also found that the main Road was busy, dusty, smelly with lots of litter. If your looking for somewhere that’s calmer and cleaner I would look elsewhere on the south coast. We did do the whale watching in Mirissa which was great! This was with the whale watching club who I would highly recommend. We also stayed in Unawatuna prior to Mirissa. Unawatuna Beach was just ok but a 5 minute tuk tuk away was Wijaya Beach which was heavenly!  Long and narrow and lined with palm trees. It was also very clean!

The buildings are almost all demolished and it just looks dirty and unwelcome. It's as if the Government and local people are just willing to let it rot away.
