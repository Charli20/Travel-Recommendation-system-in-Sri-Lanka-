We spotted two right away, we watched them from a distance. You can't say that with other tourists who we saw being touched by force, and when he couldn't reach it, he needed to touch the turtle with his feet because he was eating from the corals. Tourists have a lot of fun with them, they touch them even though there are signs prohibiting it. Many tourists chase them headlong for photos and videos and forcefully touch them! It's quite sad.","December 13, 2023"

But there are also a lot of tourists, they bring them by the busload. We lived in a hotel directly opposite and went there in the mornings when no one was there yet. Locals scurry around on the beach and offer seaweed to feed the turtles; for a bag they ask from 100 to 1000 rupees (who has the nerve) In fact, these same algae grow literally 50 meters to the left of the beach (if you are facing the ocean) on the reef, but to get to them you need slippers - there are hedgehogs there and the corals cut your feet. I heard a story that a turtle slightly nipped a tourist by the leg - it’s strange, I haven’t noticed anything like that from turtles, they are not interested in anything except algae and they don’t attack people, so you can safely go there with your children and get to know them.","December 8, 2023"

I didn't want to know.  I watched the YouTube videos by Stoner and his gf, Oblivia where they were chased down the beach by angry beach shack dogs and I thought it would be cr@p. I also have heard most of the Russian army is here hiding from the war. Well,  yes.. to both comments.. beach dogs do chase Stoner and Oblivia down the path, and there are several dozen Russians of military age constantly looking at their emails in terror. Beach is fantastic. Beach shacks are brilliant.  Surf Control is exceptional.  No telly, good music and great food. Sams Bar is also first rate and they have a strict door policy where its OK to leave drunk, but you can't show up drunk.. so a few Russians have been occasionally denied access for being off their faces. Aside from that, the real magic is the interaction with the locals... they are really nice people. Had some shirts made in English Taylor on the Gallee Road near Sams Bar. 1 day service.

They are not used to look for their food in the sea because they get food all the time. The turtle guardians are totally don‘t care for the animals. Instead they make money by giving food to tourists for feeding these poor animals! We heard that three months ago one turtle died because the people touch them with their sunblock creamy fingers!!!! By askings the guardians why they don‘t let them find food in the sea they say, that they need a job! Very sad scenario!

Although im not sure how i felt about these wild animals being in contact with humans. I had done turtle trips previously and always been advised not to touch the turtles as it can disturb their native protection, putting them at increased risk.

We were there in the mornings and evenings, walking along the white sandy beach, swimming in the calm, clear blue waters or simply enjoying - sitting and lazing around. Diving and snorkelling gear are available for hire at many locations along the beach.  You can swim to the nearby colourful reef to watch and enjoy aquatic life - the many colourful fishes darting around as well as multi-coloured corals. If you are lucky you might come across a turtle too swimming in the waters.  Diving and snorkelling were a fabulous pastime for the many visitors frequenting the beach.  The calm shallow waters between the reef and the beach was ideal for a leisurely swim.  You can quench your thirst at the many juice bars along the beach. We enjoyed the walks along the lovely wide beach with its white sands and getting into the calm waters.

Turtle beach on the end of Hikkaduwa Beach is one of the worst I have ever been to. Although there are signs to not touch the turtles tourists ignore these and push and touch the turtles.

(Don't get suckered in to first class like we did, go second. See my other review) the streets are full of shops, bars, restaurants and some street food. We felt adventurous, so got some bbq fish and chicken from a stall at the beach car park. Wow! It's local, authentic, which means the fish is roughly chopped bbq'd sauced and spiced, as is the chicken and served in a cardboard dish. Lots of meat on the fish. Beautiful. Ask for spicy otherwise it will be mild. On to the beach. All manner of water sports on offer; scuba, snorkelling, glass bottom boat, surfing hire, lessons. We just swam and snorkelled in the warm water. At the southern end of the beach large sea turtles are found while wading in the shallow reef. Not sure why they stay there, they don't seem distressed at all the people's attention. Beautiful to watch up close. Lots of coconut vendors and beachfront restaurants. We had lunch at ""Parrots paradise"" (see other review). Don't forget to have them open the nut after drinking to scrape the flesh.. yum. We also bought a small bottle of calypso white rum from a bottle shop, well worth it to top up the coconut.  Beach gets really hot in the middle of the day with not much shade around, so maybe a cafe, restaurant or bar. Morning, terrific. Great day was had. 😃","March 30, 2019"

There were quite a few surfers and lots of places where you could hire snorkels, a boat trip, scuba lessons, etc. There were also a lot of people selling coconuts, pineapples and items of clothing. If you show the slightest interest in the clothing the ladies are very difficult to say no to if you don’t agree on a price. I witnessed this with a chap who wasn’t happy with the price and the lady was very dogged in her attempt to make a sale. If you say no straight away, they leave you alone. There are a lot of fish very close to the waters edge and some locals feed them and you can see them almost jumping out of the water to get the food. We also saw a turtle very close to the beach and lots of tourists crowding around it and touching it - please do not touch them if you are lucky enough to see one yourselves.

But along with that is that it’s a town big enough to feel like you are really living among the people and can break out of the tourist scene. Not so much a place to come for nightlife, or at least not that we’ve yet found now on day five, not really looking that hard, but definitely a very nice place to chill lax and observe some Sri Lankan culture. The train ride to get here from Colombo is exceedingly affordable and breathtaking as it runs right along the coast almost the entire way. Once here, it’s very easy to just jump on a passing bus to explore further down the coast line to places like Galle which offers more high-end shopping gorgeous views and lots of interesting history. In addition to tourism, fishing is a primary industry here and another fun thing to do is to go check out where the fishing boats bring their early morning catch and watch all of the locals making their choices. Don’t miss the surrounding neighborhoods and some of the treasures that they hold, small mom-and-pop businesses that offer great value and wonderful experiences. Also don’t miss a place sectioned off on the beach where baby turtles are kept safe beneath the sand until the eggs hatch and they are kept safe from predators until they are able to make their way down to the water. You can swim right up to the sea turtles but please please don’t touch. Touching may seem harmless but chemicals that we carry on our hands, like sunscreen, is very damaging to them. Locals are OK though with you feeding the turtles bits of seaweed which is a thrill to experience even vicariously. I have yet to do it but there is a living coral reef right up near the shore where you can snorkel.","March 13, 2019"

The food was all for ‘westerners’ such as, chips, burgers, crispy chicken, flavourless rice & noodles...chicken curry came in huge portions so would need to share and ask if you want it spicy or it won’t be at all. Then long waits for meals that when eventually come are more times than not came out cold. If you want a sunbed at a particular shack you’ll need to get there about 8 am.

Some locals  are giving algaes to tourist so they can take pictures and videos. So, they end up being 3 or 4 people disturbing 1 or 2 turtles which sometimes can't even swim. And the 'funny"" part is that the same local guys giving algaes, (for money of course and that is another story...) are asking them not to touch the turtles when feeding them. It's like what they do is not bad, the problem is just when you touch the animal.... If you just ignore this horror scene and go some meters further for snorkelling, you'll probably end up surrounded by boats with glass bottoms which are taking people who don't swim. So you can't enjoy it since   you have to be careful and to look up and around instead of looking down.

They are wild animals not there to be mounted and ridden, coerced onto the beach, or stalked through the water for hours (yes some individuals wouldn’t leave them alone for hours). It would be great if the initiative could be taken in the spots where they do appear frequently for signs to remind people of this. And for beach goers to educate themselves on how to treat wildlife appropriately. Enjoy the turtles from a respectful distance whether snorkelling or paddling.. More about the beach: As is often in Sri Lanka the waves are rough, something to bear in mind if you have little ones. But they are fine if you’re a fairly good swimmer. You can find some good spots for sunbathing at points along the beach. There are the occasional littered areas in between. We walked home as the sun was going down to a nice sunset and impressive lightning on the horizon. As the beach isn’t one long strip it makes an interesting walk round all the bends.

The beach itself is nice and you can walk along and go into restaurants and bars. We also wanted to surf - but we were near the corner of the beach (stayed in Hikka Trans by Cinnamon) and there were 2 different wave patterns so it wasn't brilliant for surfing either.... this could be just where we were though and the time of year!!

Whilst Tangalle and Mirissa were lined with the flora and fauna of Sri Lanka, there were a few coconut trees in Hikkaduwa, but mostly the view is of delapidated, eery, empty hotels. Unlike elsewhere where you could easily get delicious Sri Lankan food for a good price, this place was full of naff restaurants serving expensive Western food, and poor quality at that. Perhaps the most difficult thing is the large groups of local men just wandering around gawking at tourists and in particular hassling women. Having travelled lots of the South for two weeks we expected some people to peddle their wares, but this was constant and at times quite aggressive. At one point whilst I was trying to read my book I had to tell somebody to back away because he was pestering so much. Hardly relaxing. In terms of the tourist population, whilst in other places it was full of backpackers travelling around, here it was mostly what seemed to be people on package deals just here for the beach. Unfortunately, it did give it quite a chavvy vibe and felt somewhat cheap but not cheerful, and not actually even cheap! *Perhaps most distressing was the ‘turtle watching’* Basically, a group of Sri Lankan guys encourage large sea turtles onto the shore (possibly captured and brought in) and feed them seaweed to keep them close. If tourists were to feed them seaweed they have to pay a fee. I gather if they dont pay they get quite intimidating. These tourists then go up to these beautiful creatures and distress them by petting them and taking pictures with them. It really is heartwrenching to see, and astounding how oblivious so many tourists are to how awful this practice is. Sri Lanka has so much beauty and excitement to offer - thank goodness I only spent one day here as it doesn’t show you how great Sri Lanka is. I would discourage anyone from visiting this place.","October 4, 2018"

We went there early morning, to find a group of 4 Sri Lankan men very aggressively asking for money for them to go and get the turtles out of the sea. We stayed there about an hour and this is how it works: those men stay on the beach and ask for money, they make sure you can’t go too close to the water and if a sea turtle tries to come on the beach, they scare it away back to the water to make sure you don’t see it until you pay. One of them had a knuckle duster and showed it to a tourist that was trying to find turtles with some seaweeds. A couple of tourists paid to see one, they took them in the water to make sure the rest of us would not see anything from the beach. The sea was rough and it looked like the couple did not know how to swim and was very uncomfortable, they apparently managed to get a turtle come and say hi to them for 10 sec and that was it. They also tricked some other tourists for paying 200 roupies, and once the turtle was approaching, they asked 2000 roupies. When the tourists said no, that was not the price, then they scared the turtle back to the water. Please do not go and do not pay as it entertains their business!!!","October 1, 2018"

Of course these gentlemen wanted to be paid for their time and effort and help the local community. A further (persistent)  offer to sample the local Aloe Vera was declined. The beach has many watering holes and we enjoyed some calamari and beer at the end of the morning.","June 23, 2018"

There are a few people snorkelling so you can probably see the same things without paying for the ride. However note the sea can get quite choppy, combine that with shallow waters and rocky bottoms, a boat ride is not a bad option if you are interested to see the reef.","June 20, 2018"

It is a public beach (why not), and there are plenty of people around but it is not unpleasantly crowded.and the food / beverage shacks etc add to the ambience. Yes there are boat vendors etc along the shore, but they generally accept a polite no, and don't hassle you further. We especially liked the area to the North, where most of the locals went (en masse), to enjoy themselves, and seeing them happy, made us happy too. Going into the sea from this beach is very easy and no rubber footwear required, Warning, be vigilant of the many small tourist boats that operate in a most cavalier way in the same area. I snorkelled out lots of times, wearing bright flourescent gear. However, I had to stop many times, and shout loudly at the boat crew, to make them aware of my presence.( they were too busy amusing their customers by doing fast 'doughnuts' in the water and throwing bread over for the fish) This was very unsafe practice and dangerous to swimmers.. The authorities, should segregate the boats from swimmers by roped off areas with marker buoys, as they are in many other parts of the world. It is also  a great shame to see ignorant people feeding the fish bread etc and feeding / stroking the turtles.too. Titillating as it may be for you, please stop and think, as you are changing the diet and behaviour of the marine life. Thereby, you are quite literally killing them. Maybe some informative notices need to go up along the beach ( and make sure they are in written in the Russian language too ).

Then we were kitted out with life jackets and snorkelling gear and lead to the shallow part where locals were playing in the water. There were lots of fish here, but there was no reason to pay someone to see this. Better to bring your own snorkel and enjoy. The rains came and the water became unclear so we did not see the turtles even though we went to the other side of the beach. The guy who was supposed to act as our paid life guard was sitting bored while my kids were in the water  - they were not in any danger but I realised he had oversold his credentials.

There was a wonderful local man who spent his day reminding tourist it is not okay to touch the turtles.

With most of the hotels and restaurants jealously commanding their own strip of beach in Hikkaduwa, there are only few places where you can gain free access to the beach. When you do find an access you usually find a fleet of little glass bottomed motor boats waiting to take you for a spin over what remains of the Hikkaduwa coral reef. We took a short 15 minute trip to the edge of the shallow coral reef and although the boat trip was regulated and tickets issued, you may consider it overpriced. The coral reef is very close to the shore and on our trip we were fortunate to see a large turtle as well as some large fish. The coral reef however, is a natural disaster, because much of the coral is dead, due to bleaching in 1998. Damage to the reef is also due to fishing and by boats There are a few signs of it regenerating but it will be many, many years before, if ever, it will return to its former glory. We realized afterwards that the little glass bottomed boat that we used was a contributor to the damage on the reef. The best way of seeing the reef is by snorkeling and you can be guided to the best spots. But be careful of the little glass bottomed boats.","April 3, 2018"

We decided to take a 2.5 hour cab ride down to Hikkaduwa beach after getting recommendations from locals and other travellers. We stopped by the Turtle Sanctuary which was very cool. We had been told that it was possible to spot turtles in the sea further down Hikkaduwa beach, but that we had to be very lucky to do so - especially if we arrived later in the day. We arrive to Hikkaduwa beach around 10-11am. It was raining as we made our way down to the shore but as soon as we got there we already saw a handful of people in the water, looking at a massive turtle. After having a look from the beach we rented a mask and snorkel for 500LKR each and got in the water. We were amazed! 4-5 massive turtles were calmly swimming around us - the biggest one probably around 1.5m long! Definitely one of the most amazing experiences I’ve ever had. I think the fact that it was raining made a big difference. We were told that the turtles don’t like sunlight and there was also less people swimming.","March 28, 2018"

One is very safe ( children ) with the added attraction of 2 resident ( large ) turtles wallowing around in the shallows quite happy to be handled . The longer surfing beach had hidden dangers ... Huge waves and undercurrents sometimes ... I was soon out of my depth and swept further and further out despite trying to swim closer in . Eventually I gave in and let myself be carried along knowing there was a shallow reef further down . Thankfully it worked but I paid the price and was cut to shreds on the corals ( legs / feet / arms) Be very very wary if you swim in this area . Lots of welcoming beach bars/ restaurants and free sun beds ... Some of them are doing a good trade .. Others are run down . There is a huge waste/ litter problem and the beach is crawling with feral dogs but it's spectacular nonetheless and well worth spending time walking and exploring .

Ok, for seeing sea turtles while snorkeling of the beach is a big plus for Hikkaduwa beach, better go to Narigama beach a little to the south which is within walking distance, offers nicer surf-feel places to eat, relax and drink and in general a more relaxed atmosphere. Sand brake instead of reef brake surfing for beginners is also possible here. Just ask one of the guys hanging around. Of note: Hotel Hikkatranz by Cinnamon on the south end of Hikkaduwa beach has the most organised diving centre I've seen in Sri Lanka called ""Dive for you"", highly recommended.

There is a little bit of a litter problem but it could easily be rectified if someone took responsibility for clearing it regularly. It’s not at an offensive level at present but is noticeable. The biggest problem I found with this beach is it is so difficult to access. We dropped in to visit on our train trip to Galle. After leaving Hikkaduwa train station we headed to the Galle - Colombo main road along the beach. There we encountered the fishing harbour ( no access to beach) abutting strip shops and continuous cement block walls that meant we had to walk at least 800 m before we could find a lane thru to the beach. Although it’s a tourist town Hikkaduwa is not pedestrian friendly - tuktuks, vans and trucks park over narrow footpaths and make angry gestures or toot horns at pedestrians trying to walk along the shopping strip to shop or get to the beach. Pedestrians are made to feel that they are the lowest priority which is the opposite to most western countries, so it takes some getting used to. Some of the properties along the beach encroach too far onto the beach, leaving less beach for swimmers to set up camp for the day. A lot of businesses that back onto the beach at the port / city end do not open onto the beach and are aesthetically ugly. If the local traders wish to appeal more to tourists then they may need to rethink zoning for businesses along the beach and improve access to the beach. I guess the concrete block wall may be intended as a barrier to flooding but perhaps a stairway or pedestrian bridges could improve beach access. Until access improves I would rate Unawatuna as the best close proximity  beach for tourists who are staying in Galle I think Hikkaduwa could be a highly rated beach for tourists, with a few improvements to better accomodate them. I’m saying this from the perspective that I think tourism is an important economic driver and employment focus for this town.","March 15, 2018"

The beach is calm, water is warm, and you can enjoy a swim. The locals are friendly, sellers wandering the beach do not harass you. A simple ‘no thank you’ will suffice. Towards the Hikka Tranz hotel end of the beach, you get to swim with the turtles. The turtles do not mind the people but tends to get over crowded. For quieter time with the turtles, go visit them in the morning, take few sea plants with you to feed them. You will get great pictures. You can snorkel or swim with them too. To view the corals, you will need to take the boat out into the sea, it is about 10-15 minutes boat ride. Fish comes up right on the beaches. A great place for who are not yet able to snorkel and dive. It is wonderful to see various type of fishes swimming along with you.

Good waves for a variety of skill levels off several reefs a short paddle from the sand. Good snorkelling along the reefs - big fish, turtles although the reef itself is underwhelming. Lots of good quality restaurants and bars on the sand. Surfboards, boogie boards & snorkelling gear available for rent at several outlets. Several guest houses offer free sun lounges if you patronise their restaurants. Narigama is the best stretch of beach although recent storms have claimed a lot of sand but it is coming back. Vendors wander the beach selling coconuts, massages, sarongs, bedcovers, woodwork, beads etc. A friendly vibe, great for people watching but with less crowds compared to Marissa and surrounds.","January 18, 2018"

I didn't choose the best time of year to visit as it was off season, mostly cloudy weather wasn't that great but I still enjoyed it. I did snorkeling although I would advise a different season as the water is not that clear due to climate change. Around 6pm the turtles how up on shore and allow you to feed them. There is a story behind why they return everyday the same time, which one of the locals will explain to you, while feeding you'll admire beautiful sunset. Which ultimately is my favorite part, I love sunsets. Besides the weather I had the best massage and seaweed wrap at one of the spa's in the main road. I can't recall the name as there were so many I literally just walked in without paying attention to the name.

The beaches on the south part 400 meters south from Hikka Tranz Hotel ist the best part with lots of sunbeds and you can watch the surfers. In the northern part the wastewater from all the hotels goes to the ocean :( The only thing is the crazy busy street, you have to pass it carefully. The tourist board should slow down the traffic.","December 13, 2017"

Amazing view of the beaches all the way to the Hikkaduwa beach. The place we went to was a diving school with PADI certified divers. Me and my son went diving with them and the experience was awesome. Though the reefs are not in good condition but the sea life is aplenty. The dive and the instructions takes around three hours and we were tired. The Chilled beer and the spicy seafood was perfect for the setting sun. We went ahead to Galle to visit the Dutch Fort....,"December 8, 2017"
